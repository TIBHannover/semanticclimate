## Navigation to the IPCC chapters and the IPCC glossaries

The goal is to make the IPCC reports and other material semantic. This is quite a reasonable place to come in, the synthesis report, here which is the 2023 summary, "**the handbook for the survival of humanity**" according to Guterres.

So what you will see is about this report, but it also links to the other reports. So if you go to [ipcc](https://www.ipcc.ch) and that gives you the synthesis report and then there are three working groups.
### There are seven reports.
- **WG1**
	- [IPCC/ar6/wg1](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) report with 12 chapters
	- The title is "**Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis**"

- **WG2**
    - [IPCC/ar6/wg2](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) report with 18 chapters
    - The title is "**Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability**"

- **WG3**
    - [IPCC/ar6/wg3](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/) report with 17 chapters
    - The title is "**Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change**"

- AR6 [**Synthesis Report** (syr)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/)


- **SR15**
    - SPECIAL REPORT on [Global Warming of 1.5 ÂºC](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/)

- **SRCCL**
    - SPECIAL REPORT on [Climate Change and Land](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/)

- **SROCC**
    - Special Report on the [Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/)


### Overview of the reports
There's working group one which is physical science, working group two, which is adaptation and working group three which is mitigation.

And then there are special reports, there's a special report on ocean and Cryosphere.
Cryosphere means all the frozen water on the planet.
So icebergs, glaciers, ice sheets and so on.

There's one on land, climate change and land.

And then there's one on the effect and of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C we have and that makes up seven reports.


So there are other reports that we may look at and there may be other reports from other United Nations organizations or from other scientific and governmental organizations.


But these are the seven reports we're looking at, synthesis, WG1, WG2, WG3 and Cryosphere, land and 1.5.

### About the glossary
Now, the other thing that we use, which isn't linked from here is a `glossary`.

[Glossary](https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/) is a *collection of terms with some additional informations*. This has got 931 terms in it.

And it's designed for people to browse through.

So if you don't know what Cryosphere is, you go to see and then you scroll through here and you find Cryosphere and it tells you that it's the components of the earth system below the land and ocean surface that are frozen.

We believe that the things in italics here are largely pointers to the terms in the glossary.

### About the reports and glossary in the semantic climate repository on github

So if we go to github and semantic climate, then we have a repository [here](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate).

The `petermr/semanticClimate` one is the data from the IPCC.

So, semantic climate is our repository. And there's a lot of stuff there, but the one we're looking at, at the moment is IPCC. 
The repository is arranged like a directory structure.

So if we click on this, we'll see a whole number of subdirectories here.

The one we want is AR6 and then under that you can see all of the reports there, the working groups and the special reports.

So if, for example, we go to WG3, we've got all the chapters there.

Most of what we're looking at is in the glossary.
I've made a special directory here which is not very cleverly named `test`.

So, we go into that and then we've got another copy of all of the reports and total glossary.

And what we're looking at is something called total glossary.
