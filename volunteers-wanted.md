## Planet-saving information is a terrible thing to waste

If we are to hold any hope of mitigating the effects of [greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q112192791) on our planet and its inhabitants, we must ensure that the latest scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change is not just widely available, but immediately comprehensible to politicians, industrialists, educators, citizens, and scientists alike.

Our most important and up-to-date resource, the [UN IPCC AR6 Climate Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/), is a **50-chapter, 10,000 page monster** filled to the brim with climate-science information and data...and all of it trapped in the [inflexible PDF format](https://wiki.c2.com/?PdfSucks).

## **The medium is the monkey wrench**

As if the sheer volume and complexity of the information weren't enough, the [PDF format](https://wiki.c2.com/?PdfSucks) itself throws a spanner in the works:

1. **Meaning is lost in the haze of acronyms, abbreviations and scientific jargon** densely populating these important documents. These documents set a very high bar for comprehension (and therefore, attention) from policy makers that should be championing the cause — let alone the coalition of willing laypeople needed to implement meaningful changes on a global scale. Throughout this document and others like it, such terms must be understandable, [in situ](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216681).
2. **An untapped wealth of knowledge remains buried in the document's rich text, charts, graphs and images**. It must therefore be made machine-readable so that it can be mined, extracted, and exported to new and potentially planet-saving uses.

We need to not only remove these obstacles, we need to create entirely new possibilities! 
And that's where <a href="mailto:semanticclimate+volunteer@gmail.com?subject=I want to be a #semanticClimate Volunteer!&body=I want to volunteer for the #semanticClimate task force!">**_YOU_**</a> come into the picture!

# The _#semanticClimate_ task force needs YOU!!

[#semanticClimate](https://semanticclimate.github.io/p/en/posts/oaweek_getting_started/) is an industrious, international, multi-talented group of young scientists of diverse fields. Together, we are developing a FREE open-access [toolkit](http://www.semantictoolkit.org) that releases climate-related knowledge from PDF prison.

## **OUR** MISSION

We transform and enrich climate-related documents to make them understandable, useful, and accessible to anyone and everyone— be they citizens, scientists, or policy-makers.

## **YOUR** <a href="mailto:semanticclimate+volunteer@gmail.com?subject=I want to be a #semanticClimate Volunteer!&body=I want to volunteer for the #semanticClimate task force!">MISSION</a> _(should you choose to accept it...)_

**Join us! Apply your skills!** Be a part of building and enhancing powerful new tools that take information and transforms it into new, structured, filtered, and actionable knowledge!

**In alpha-tests, our toolkit is successfully:**

- **converting PDFs** into editable and accessible HTML, XML, and CSV;
- **extracting important keywords and concepts** from the text (including named entities, scientific terms, acronyms, and abbreviations);
- **creating specialized dictionaries and glossaries** linking those terms to wikidata entries containing their definition; and,
- **semantically enriching the converted HTML with annotations linked to the wikidata** so that anyone can simply click on, or mouse-over an unknown term to learn their meaning, thus making comprehension of these critically important documents available to everyone — even machines!

**_And this is just the beginning!_** Imagine what will be possible with <a href="mailto:semanticclimate+volunteer@gmail.com?subject=I want to be a #semanticClimate Volunteer!&body=I want to volunteer for the #semanticClimate task force!">**_YOU_**</a> on our team!
