# Basis of collaboration

`#semanticClimate` is essentially a bottom-up, volunteer, meritocratic project. We share the need to create 
working systems where different people contribute a variety of tools and functionality. This is common in OpenSource 
projects but requires communal discipline:
* we need to know what each of us is doing
* we can help each other find and overcome problems
* we need to know that the pieces fit together and work properly. 
* we need to interact with the outside world, especially those who want to use the tools

We communicate both *synchronously* (2 or more people talking in a group) and *asynchronously* where we leaves messages 
that can be answered, re-answered, etc. 

This is not trivial. The world has created a variety of tools and here are the ones we have found most useful. 
Access rights are always a problem (we have been Zoom-bombed; not fun).

# Asynchronous

## Open Notebook Science 
As far as possible everything we do is available to the outside world as soon as it is done and is permanent. 
See [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science). The methods we use include:
* Github repositories (mainly code and documents)
* Github Issues (mainly for problems, e.g. bugs)
* Jupyter/Colab Notebooks (mainly for learning and simple prototyping)
* Github Discussions

## openVirus Slack

*(openVirus is a historic name where semanticCliamte is discussed)*
Slack is neither permanent nor public. We use it internally for rapid ephemeral messages but the unpaid Slack dies 
after ca. 2 months. If you want to join the project more permanently we can add your email.

## Etherpad

This is a very ephemeral shared (text) pad without structure that *anyone* can write on. It preserves history (character-by-character).
It uses security-by-obscurity (i.e. the URL is not discoverable by chance) and is effortless to use. It's very useful for things like:
* interchanging URLs
* making ad hoc lists
* introductions
* text-cut-and-paste

* Regard all content as public.

***We'll open an Etherpad for the duration of the OpenAccess Week, and delete a few days after***. 
If you want something, copy it somewhere safe.

# Synchronous

We use Skype, Teams (when we have to) but for OAWeek we only use:

## Zoom
We've used many tools over the years, e.g. Discord, Gathertown (fun tool) but generally use Zoom in paid-for mode (University of Cambridge). 
Sometimes we use *breakout rooms* where separate conmversations can take place but for OAWeek we'd plan to have just the 
main room. Zoom Chat is ephemeral - dispappears after the session - (and tricky to copy). You'll need an invite from us. 
PM-R is guaranteeing to be present at 1230 UTC each day. If there is a critucal mass of people at other times we can 
open an impromptu session.
